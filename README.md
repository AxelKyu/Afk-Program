# Afk-Program

Afk-Program is a cross-platform tool that prevents devices (Windows, Mac, and Linux) from going to sleep or entering idle mode. The program includes an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for starting and stopping sleep prevention with just a click. This is perfect for ensuring that long-running processes, downloads, or streams arenâ€™t interrupted when you're away from your machine.

## Features
